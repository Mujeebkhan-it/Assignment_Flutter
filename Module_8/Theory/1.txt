Q - 1. Explain the difference between local storage options (shared_preferences, SQLite).

    SharedPreferences is for simple key-value pair storage (like settings, flags, and small user preferences). 
Itâ€™s best for small, unstructured data that doesn't require complex queries.

    SQLite is a full relational database used to store structured data (with tables, rows, columns). 
It supports complex queries, relationships, and is suited for larger, more complex data.

When to use:
    Use SharedPreferences for small app settings and preferences.
    Use SQLite for storing structured data that requires querying, updating, or relationships between data.
