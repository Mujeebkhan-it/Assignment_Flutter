Q - 1. Explain what a RESTful API is and its importance in mobile applications.

    A RESTful API is a set of guidelines for building web services that allow mobile apps to communicate with 
servers over HTTP. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), 
PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).

Importance in Mobile Apps:
--------------------------

Data Exchange:         Enables mobile apps to retrieve and send data to remote servers.

Backend Communication: Helps mobile apps interact with databases, cloud services, 
                       and third-party services.

Platform Independence: Allows apps on different platforms (iOS, Android) to communicate with the 
                       same server using standard protocols.
