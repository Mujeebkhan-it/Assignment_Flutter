1. Explain how the Navigator widget works in Flutter.
-----------------------------------------------------

    The Navigator widget in Flutter is a core concept used for managing routing and navigation 
between different screens (also called routes) in an application.
It provides a stack-based navigation system where screens or pages are pushed onto the stack and 
popped off to navigate between them.


Push and Pop Operations:

    Push: When a new screen is pushed onto the navigator, itâ€™s placed on top of the current stack, 
    and the screen becomes visible. For example, calling 
    Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewScreen())) 
    will push a new screen onto the stack.
    
    Pop: When you want to go back to the previous screen, you can pop the current screen off the stack. 
    This is done using Navigator.pop(context).
